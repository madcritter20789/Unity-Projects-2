## Balloon Escape

It is a 2D game I developed and designed where you control a balloon navigating through a challenging dungeon. Using the W, A, S, D keys or arrow keys, you guide the balloon to reach the end of the dungeon and advance to the next stage.

The game features two types of power-ups:  
**Invincibility Power-Up**: Temporarily makes the balloon immune to traps.  
**Shrink Power-Up**: Reduces the balloonâ€™s size, allowing it to pass through tight spaces.  
  
However, if you get caught in a trap, the game restarts from the beginning. Successfully reaching the end of the dungeon lets you progress to the next level.

## Hunt Moster

Hunt Monster is a **2D wave-based game** that I developed while learning through the Blackthornprod game development course. This project played a crucial role in expanding my understanding of game mechanics, enemy design, and wave progression. I also received a certification from the university upon completing the course.


**Gameplay Overview**  
In Hunt Monster, you control a character that can shoot in any direction by clicking on the screen. The goal is to survive waves of enemies, defeating them to advance to the next wave.   

The game features two types of monster enemies:  
**Land Monsters:** These charge at you and attempt to attack.  
**Flying Monsters:** These enemies shoot projectiles to damage you from a distance.


You start with **5 lives**, and if you lose them all, the game ends. However, defeated enemies will **randomly drop either new weapons or health packs, allowing you to recover lost lives or upgrade your weapon**.

**Weapons & Power-ups**  
The game features **three types of weapons, each with varying shooting power and speed**. Players can switch between these weapons as they are dropped by enemies, adding strategic variety to the gameplay.

**Boss Fight**  
After surviving several waves, a Boss Monster appears. **The boss can summon smaller monsters and enters a second phase when its health drops below half, where it becomes faster and more aggressive**.
