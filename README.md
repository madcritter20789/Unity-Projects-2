## Balloon Escape

It is a 2D game I developed and designed where you control a balloon navigating through a challenging dungeon. Using the W, A, S, D keys or arrow keys, you guide the balloon to reach the end of the dungeon and advance to the next stage.

The game features two types of power-ups:  
**Invincibility Power-Up**: Temporarily makes the balloon immune to traps.  
**Shrink Power-Up**: Reduces the balloonâ€™s size, allowing it to pass through tight spaces.  
  
However, if you get caught in a trap, the game restarts from the beginning. Successfully reaching the end of the dungeon lets you progress to the next level.
